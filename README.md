# Photography Portfolio Prototype Website

## Overview

Prototype of a Photography Portfolio Website. It would be a website for photographers to display their projects and talents. This was a commission from a client and I was given permission to display it. This website just contains a home page currently. This project incorporated HTML and CSS and gave me experience with a background slideshow effect.

## Features:

### Navigation

The website conatins a basic navigation bar, decending vertically and centered. There is also an icon button to direct to external social media sites. The buttons do not lead to anywhere currently.

### Slideshow Background

The background of the website is an animated slideshow displaying sample photos. This sidescrolling is produced with CSS animation only. The photos used are not owned by me and are only filler. The slideshow scrolls thorugh the images in a specific order, and when it reaches the end, it will slide in reverse back to the beginning.
